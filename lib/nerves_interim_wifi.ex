  @moduledoc """
  The Nerves.InterimWiFi application handles the low level details of connecting
  to WiFi networks. To quickly get started, create a new Nerves project and add
  the following line someplace early on in your program:

      Nerves.InterimWiFi.setup "wlan0", ssid: "myssid", key_mgmt: :"WPA-PSK", psk: "secretsecret"

  When you boot your Nerves image, Nerves.InterimWiFi monitors for an interface
  called "wlan0" to be created. This occurs when you plug in a USB WiFi dongle.
  If you plug in more than one WiFi dongle, each one will be given a name like
  "wlan1", etc. Those may be setup as well.

  When not connected, Nerves.InterimWiFi continually scans
  for the desired access point. Once found, it associates and runs DHCP to
  acquire an IP address.

  IMPORTANT: This module is called Nerves.InterimWiFi for a reason. Some
  functionality is missing or awaiting refactoring. The largest pending change is to change how events are
  handled, and that mostly affects how things work internally. Externally, the event change
  will allow you to receive notifications of when connections occur or are
  broken. This doesn't mean that it's
  unusable, though. If you have fixes that make this work better for your setup, please
  consider sharing them.
